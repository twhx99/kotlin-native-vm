## Kotlin Native VM

In this (learning) project we try to develop a full VM in the programming language Kotlin/Native step by step.

The goal is to be able to execute own byte- or assembler code in this VM.

### Requirements for the VM
- [ ] The VM should implement the most important arithmetic operations and execute them quickly and reliably.
- [ ] The VM should be lightweight and platform independent.
- [ ] The VM should be able to process several operations simultaneously.
